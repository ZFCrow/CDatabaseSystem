# Module Database System in C

# Overview 
This C-based database system employs a linked list to store information about academic modules. It features a modular design, utilizing a node struct that contains a module struct. The module struct holds essential details such as module code, module name, and module credits. The program utilizes bubble sort for sorting and supports all four CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

#Features
Linked List Structure: Utilizes a linked list for efficient data organization.

Modular Design: The program is modularized, breaking down functionality into well-defined modules for better maintainability.

Bubble Sort: Provides sorting functionality using the bubble sort algorithm, allowing users to sort based on module code, module name, or module credits.

CRUD Operations:

Create: Add new modules with module code, module name, and module credits.
Read: View the list of stored modules.
Update: Modify information about a specific module.
Delete: Remove a module from the database.
